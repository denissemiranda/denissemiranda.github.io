  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>My name is Denisse Miranda, I'm a creative marketer and former graphic designer based in Mexico.</p>
  <p>I have been doing websites and building online communities since 2002! SEO and digital marketing since 2007. Facebook was a weird thing, Twitter was in diapers! Since 2014 I have worked in agencies and corporates as a Digital Manager. I am a super multidisciplinary and workaholic person so I have found passion in creating digital strategies and doing <b>Marketing Automation</b> (Pardot, Marketo, Eloqua), <b>Email Marketing</b> and <b>Performance Marketing</b>. SEO and Social Media Marketing are probably the things I love the most, aside from beautiful reports of good results. Brand strategy is always the core of my work. I have multiple certifications in Digital Media, including Adwords (Now Google Ads) and Hubspot Inbound Marketing. I love helping startups to find their way in a world full of digital marketing posibilities! Let's work together! </p>
  <p><a href="https://www.behance.net/denissemiranda">Behance portafolio here!</a></p>
  <p>I'm available for freelance projects! you can find me in Twitter as @_denissemiranda and in Facebook as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denissemiranda.marketing">Denisse Miranda</a></p>
